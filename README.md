# DEVS WEB WORKSHOP 2020

Welcome to the git repository for DEVS' Web Workshop for 2020! Here you will find setup instructions to be completed before the workshop, as well as pre set-up files for our demo application.

# Getting started

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A text editor which we will be writing our code in.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Used to run our javascript code.
